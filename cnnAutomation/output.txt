Welcome back to a four-day workweek, aka what every week should be. Let's get into it.   THE HANGOVER If you're feeling a little sluggish today after the long weekend, you're not alone. Wall Street spent last week partying, notching back-to-back records. But today, it seemed like traders stumbled into work in sunglasses, chugging black coffee as they tried to stay awake at their Bloomberg terminals.    The Dow tumbled 209 points Tuesday, after ending last week at an all-time high. The S&P 500, fresh off its seven-record closing streak, fell 0.2%.   It wasn't clear what sparked the selloff, but a few factors may have played a role:  Oil market chaos: Oil prices soared and then retreated Tuesday after OPEC countries failed to reach a deal on production increases. That's left investors scratching their heads over what comes next.   Summer slump: Even bankers go on vacay, and when trading volume is low, that can exacerbate volatility.   Stocks to watch: AMC popped 5% in early trading Tuesday after the company announced it's ditching plans to sell 25 million additional shares. (The stock pared those gains, ultimately finishing down nearly 4%.) The sale would have allowed it to capitalize on its success as a Reddit-backed "meme stock," which has driven shares up more than 2,300% this year. At the same time, a sale would have diluted value for existing shareholders. Didi, which made its US debut only last week, plunged 25% Tuesday after Chinese regulators banned its ride-hailing platform from app stores over the weekend, citing cybersecurity risks.    Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is one of the most heavily shorted stocks among customers of online broker TradeZero America. Shares have nearly doubled this year, and the company made a surprise announcement last week that its founder would take off in Virgin's rocket-powered plane on July 11 â€” nine days before Jeff Bezos' planned July 20 launch.  NUMBER OF THE DAY  $10 BILLION  Here's some high-level drama with deeply petty roots: The Department of Defense is canceling a $10 billion cloud computing contract, known as JEDI, that the Trump administration awarded to Microsoft over Amazon in 2019. The contract was supposed to modernize the Pentagon's IT, and Amazon, the market leader in cloud computing, seemed like a shoo-in. (But remember: Trump, a wildly unsuccessful businessman, hated Jeff Bezos, a wildly successful CEO.) Amazon sued over the decision, saying it was politically motivated. Now the DoD plans to solicit bids for a new, updated contract from both Microsoft and Amazon.  WORK LESS  The latest from the Department of Why Is This Still A Thing?: 40-hour workweeks are pointless and even harmful. And scientists are proving it.  THE NEWS  Researchers in Iceland are calling trials of a shorter workweeks an "overwhelming success," after productivity improved and workers reported feeling less burned out.   In two large trials between 2015 and 2019, public sector employees were asked to reduce their work time by about five hours a week, without reducing their pay. To the surprise of literally no one, the workers' wellbeing improved dramatically.   After shortening the workweek to about 35 or 36 hours, instead of 40, researchers found that productivity and services stayed the same or improved across the majority of workplaces. WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON Software vendor Kaseya said that up to 1,500 businesses have been compromised by a ransomware attack that unfolded late last week and has ricocheted around the world.  Subway is completely revamping its menu this week, hoping to turn around years of declining sales.  Former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns has been named chairwoman of Teneo, the embattled consulting firm whose CEO resigned last week, reportedly over drunken behavior at a party. 

'They need a radical restructure': Six months after January 6, Capitol Police struggling to adapt to threats
Jul 6, 2021
Amid mounting concern about a fresh wave of pro-Trump violence in August, more than a dozen current and former Capitol Police officers, Capitol security officials, lawmakers and aides tell CNN that not nearly enough has been done to address the security failures exposed by the January 6 attack on the US Capitol six months ago. The mere shock of the event, and the criticism that followed, has pushed the US Capitol Police Department to make some quick changes -- rank-and-file officers now get daily intelligence alerts on their cell phones. New tactical gear like helmets, batons and goggles have been purchased. And two former department leaders have been hired as security consultants to streamline improvements. But the sweeping reforms that are widely seen as necessary to prevent a similar attack remain elusive, especially an operational and cultural overhaul of the department that some believe will take years to achieve, if it can happen at all. "They need a radical restructure. They need to decouple it from any political structure whatsoever," said Rep. John Katko, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee who negotiated the bipartisan agreement for an independent commission that was blocked by Republican leaders. "They've definitely made strides in the right direction," Katko said. "But they're nowhere near where they should be." Morale remains low among Capitol Police officers, who say they're stuck working longer hours amid dwindling ranks. More than 75 officers have left since January 6, at a rate of about three per week, according to union leaders. "We're losing guys left and right," said one officer, who like others interviewed for this story requested anonymity to speak candidly about the state of the US Capitol Police. "The young guys don't want to be here and the old guys who are eligible are just rolling out." As a result, the department has already exceeded its overtime projections for the fiscal year, which doesn't end for another three months, according to a Senate aide. Capitol Police still lacks a permanent leader following Chief Steve Sund's resignation after January 6. And political fighting in Congress has stymied efforts to give the department millions of dollars in new funding -- and establish an independent commission to investigate what led to the attack. Last week House Democrats voted over the objections of all but two House Republicans to create a new Select Committee, which will examine Capitol security failures in addition to the circumstances leading up to the attack. It's unclear though what, if any changes that will lead to. Meanwhile, threats against lawmakers are up significantly in 2021, and over the past few weeks, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have issued warnings of the potential for summer violence tied to conspiracy theories that Trump will return to the presidency in August. There have also been reports that the fencing surrounding the Capitol may come down as early as July 8. At a recent roll call meeting for rank-and-file officers, the department's new intelligence director was asked what preparations were being made in response to the conspiracy theories being shared online -- and whether they could prompt pro-Trump supporters to once again descend on the Capitol. According to one source who described the meeting, the response was that nothing was being done yet, but the situation was being monitored -- which the person said felt like status quo. "What are we going to do different once the fence comes down?" said another officer. "We haven't made any changes to prepare for it -- zero -- that's what I'm worried about." A Capitol Police spokesperson declined to grant interviews with Capitol Police leadership for this article and did not answer specific questions submitted by CNN. Instead, the department pointed to a statement released Tuesday morning about the changes that have been made following January 6. Capitol Police said it has beefed up training for riots and other scenarios, provided additional protections for lawmakers outside of Washington and is in the process of setting up field offices in California and Florida. It also says it's ramped up critical incident response planning, purchased new equipment for officers and improved communication with rank-and-file officers related to intelligence. "Throughout the last six months, the United States Capitol Police has been working around the clock with our congressional stakeholders to support our officers, enhance security around the Capitol Complex, and pivot towards an intelligence-based protective agency," wrote acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman. Politics has held up funding The same political debate that has tainted most discussions of the January 6 attack has also mired down additional funding for Capitol Police. House Democrats passed a $2 billion supplemental funding bill for Capitol security over the objections of Republicans -- who raised issues with some of the line items, like a rapid response force coming from the National Guard. In the Senate, the bill has languished, and lawmakers may slide it into the annual congressional spending process, where new spending decisions can often be kicked months into a fiscal year before a deal is reached. Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who chairs the House Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee that funds Capitol Police, released a fiscal 2022 spending bill that would give Capitol Police an $88 million funding boost compared to the current budget, though it's $15 million below the administration's budget request, which would allow for the hiring of new officers and civilian officials for Capitol Police. But that funding could still be months from being approved. "There's so much we need to do comprehensively, and it takes time, but most of it starts in the bill," Ryan said in an interview. "I'm not happy about where we are. We've got to be moving a lot quicker." Changes on the margins Meanwhile, Capitol Police leaders have tried to implement operational and cultural changes. For example, one Capitol security official said there's been an effort to better use intelligence to drive operations. The department has also increased communication with law enforcement partners, according to a congressional source familiar with the USCP, and it is now working with private vendors to obtain open-source social media information to track threats, the source said. Officers who spoke to CNN say they now receive daily email updates on their cell phones, for instance, including about demonstrations planned and intelligence. Some, however, have questioned how useful the updates have been. "We're inundated with updates now," one officer said. There have also been some extra training sessions, officers say, including how to hand-cuff people hit by a taser. One officer told CNN most of his training occurs online. Another officer described walk-throughs for Senate and House chamber evacuations. Capitol Police said Tuesday that its Civil Disturbance Unit, which was on the frontlines on January 6, has increased training for riots and less-than-lethal exercises, conducted a joint exercise with the National Guard, and sent CDU officials to train in Seattle and Virginia Beach. Terry Gainer, a former US Capitol Police chief and Senate sergeant at arms, said that while intelligence sharing with rank-and-file officers is a positive sign, there's a lot more that needs to be done to help a police force still struggling with the physical and psychological trauma of January 6. "When you're still working long hours and there's a lot of change going on and people are wondering 'When are we going to get a new chief? Is there going to be some independent commission? Are some of the members going to stop pretending this didn't happen?' All of that weighs heavy," said Gainer, who is also a CNN contributor. Fixing the command structure The Capitol Police Board has spent the past few months searching for a new chief. A selection could come as soon as this month, said the congressional source. Until then, the department will continue to be led by Pittman, who replaced Sund as acting chief after he resigned January 7. Not long after Pittman took over, officers' frustrations spilled into public view as members of the Capitol Police force issued an overwhelming vote of no confidence in their leadership in February. Capitol Police union leader Gus Papathanasiou told CNN he was hopeful that a new police chief will "change things around," but he echoed the frustrations of officers that not enough has been done. "I think it's just the same as it was on January 5, if not worse," he said. Papathanasiou also criticized Pittman in a statement released by the union on Tuesday, saying her "lack of leadership had tragic consequences" during the riot. The statement went on to say that Papathanasiou's top priority was addressing officer retention, with "longstanding inequities built into the system that propel officers out of the force or prove a barrier to recruitment" needing to be rectified. Katko, the Republican congressman, said he wants to see the structure of Capitol Police leadership changed altogether. The Capitol Police chief reports to a police board that includes Congressionally appointed House and Senate sergeants at arms and the Architect of the Capitol. The police board's response as the January 6 riot unfolded fell under particular scrutiny, as the Capitol Police chief could not unilaterally request assistance from the National Guard. "If it's a police force, you've got to have a command structure that's commensurate with law enforcement and security," Katko said. "I think it's as bad as I've ever seen at any law enforcement agency anywhere. We're asking them to do extraordinary things with zero guidance." Senate Rules Committee leaders Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, introduced legislation in June to expand the chief's authority to request National Guard assistance in an emergency and to compel the Capitol Police Board to appear together in front of both chambers of Congress -- something the senators said hasn't happened since 1945, though the board has appeared together at other types of congressional hearings in recent years. Dealing with online threats Capitol security officials say that even with additional threats toward lawmakers, the notion Capitol Police would be surprised again on the scale of January 6 remains remote. However, officers said they'd like to see more credence given to the threats that have swirled on far-right channels online. One Capitol security official stressed that a rise in Internet threats -- which can ebb and flow in a single afternoon based on a media interaction or a viral trigger -- shouldn't prompt Capitol Police to leap into overdrive.

Republican candidates back Trump's election lies across the 2021 and 2022 maps
Jul 6, 2021
Republican candidates in a spate of 2021 races and in the 2022 midterms are increasingly focusing their campaigns on the baseless claim that voter fraud was a rampant problem in the 2020 election. Some GOP contenders are still falsely asserting that former President Donald Trump was robbed of victory last year -- a lie Trump himself has told at rallies he has held in recent weeks that have focused largely on his attempts to settle old scores and elevate Republicans who are willing to amplify his falsehoods. Dozens of Republicans campaigning on Trump's election lies are seeking statewide offices that would give them authority over how elections are conducted and which ballots are counted. Others are running for congressional and state legislative seats, where they could shape voting laws. In Arizona, state Rep. Mark Finchem -- who was in Washington during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol -- is running for secretary of state, a position that would make him the state's chief elections officer, on the claim that the widely panned and problem-plagued "audit" of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots ordered by state Senate Republicans could somehow upend President Joe Biden's victory in the state. "What I would be in favor of is reclaiming our electors and denying the current occupant of the White House ... those electoral college votes," Finchem said in an April 1 town hall-style presentation about the audit. "If you have enough states to pull those back and you get below to 270, we now have an illegitimate president." Kristina Karamo, a Republican candidate for secretary of state in Michigan, claims that Trump won the state -- even though Biden won Michigan by more than 154,000 votes. She is calling for an Arizona-style audit in the Upper Midwestern battleground. "People mocking the audit are really ignorant," Karamo said in Lansing on June 29. "No, common sense tells you if someone is doing something effectively, you learn from them that what you can replicate the process yourself." Wren Williams, a first-time candidate for a state legislative seat in Virginia, said he believes President Joe Biden was duly elected because his victory was certified by Congress -- but he claims that was based on state certifications of vote totals that "are not exactly wholly accurate." Williams was a member of Trump's legal team that attempted to overturn the election results in Wisconsin. Last month, he ousted a 14-year incumbent member of the Virginia House of Delegates after campaigning largely on election fraud concerns. He is now likely to win that safely Republican seat this fall. "I have seen enough discrepancies throughout at least Wisconsin that would overturn the Wisconsin election," Williams said, pointing to what he called a series of problems, such as lax enforcement of laws about who qualifies to vote by mail and clerks helping some voters complete their ballots. "There are issues like what I'm saying and then there are issues like the Kraken," Williams said. He was attempting to draw a distinction between his concerns about fraud and bigger right-wing conspiracy theories, including the baseless promises of far-right attorney Sidney Powell to "release the kraken," a reference to the mythical creature. (Powell pursued a flood of post-election lawsuits that she'd said would prove widespread voter fraud, which ultimately failed.) But experts disagreed, saying that Williams and other Republicans making bigger promises are ultimately trafficking in the same lies about election fraud. "It might be more palatable and that might just be with the way they've learned to sell themselves, but it really is coming from the same place," said Sylvia Albert, the director of voting and elections for the good-government group Common Cause. Loyal to Trump The crop of Republican candidates who are advancing election lies is in many ways a response to a base that remains loyal to Trump and has bought into his falsehoods. A Monmouth University poll last month found that 1-in-3 Americans believes Biden won the 2020 election due to voter fraud, and more than 3-in-5 Republicans believe fraud was responsible for Biden's win. Trump, meanwhile, has returned to holding campaign-style rallies, in part in an effort to punish Republicans who have broken with him. Trump recently began his revenge tour in Lorain County, Ohio, where he lambasted US Rep. Anthony Gonzalez for voting to impeach him earlier this year and sought to boost Max Miller, a former Trump aide who is challenging the congressman in the district's Republican primary next year. "Max's opponent is a guy named Anthony Gonzalez, who's bad news. He's a grandstanding RINO, not respected in DC, who voted for the unhinged, unconstitutional, illegal impeachment witch hunt," Trump said at the rally. Some Republicans who broke with Trump over his voter fraud lies -- including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp -- have attempted to ease the intra-party political pressure they face in part by implementing new laws that will make some methods of voting harder. That push for strict new voting laws has dominated legislatures in Republican-controlled states this year, with Georgia, Florida and Iowa among the states that have implemented new laws and a special session set to begin in Texas, where GOP leaders hope to enact similar restrictions. Other Republicans are trying to avoid Trump's wrath by walking back their previous criticism of the former president. J.D. Vance, the "Hillbilly Elegy" author and Ohio Senate candidate, is apologizing for 2016 tweets in which he criticized Trump. In posts first unearthed by CNN's KFile, Vance repeatedly bashed Trump during the 2016 campaign -- calling the billionaire businessman "reprehensible" and saying that "in 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump's voters who fought him most aggressively." Vance also tweeted out that he had voted for Evan McMullin in the 2016 election. But on Fox News Monday, Vance was backtracking from his criticism of Trump. "Like a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016," Vance said. "And I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said in 2016, because I've been very open that I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy. I think he was a good president, I think he made a lot of good decisions for people and I think he took a lot of flak." Still, even some of Trump's allies -- those willing to claim voter fraud altered the result of the 2020 election -- say there is political peril to insisting that elections are rigged. "Now I have this huge issue show up that basically, people aren't willing to trust the system," Williams said. "And I'm like, 'Look, we need you to vote.' "
